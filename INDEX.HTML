            <h2>Does Gun Control Actually Work in America?</h2>

            <div>

                <p>Gun violence has continued to plague America for decades, making it among the top ten countries with the highest number of gun-related deaths globally. According to the Pew Research Center, the highest reported gun-related deaths in U.S. history were reported in 2021. This means that the problem is increasing, and it calls for drastic measures to deal with the issue. History has shown us psychopaths entering schools and spraying students with bullets or opening fire at movie theatres and public areas. Such cases send chills down the spines of many Americans as they wonder what the solution to gun violence in a country that is regarded as the echelon of civilization could be. Some have argued that stricter gun control measures could be the solution. This paper discusses whether stricter gun control measures actually work. The scourge of gun violence in America has raised international concern, and it calls for measures to create a safer America and keep countless lives from going down the drain.</p>

                <p>Countries like Mexico, which have some of the strictest gun ownership policies in the world, still have higher gun-related homicides than the United States. This means that simply limiting access to guns is not likely to solve the problem of endemic gun violence. Usually, criminals and psychopaths can find ways of obtaining guns, regardless of how strict gun control measures are (National Rifle Association). Hence, making it more difficult for the typical American to own a firearm is not likely to help decrease gun violence. Usually, about 75% of homicides are committed using illegally owned firearms. Therefore, even with stricter gun control laws, criminals will still find ways to obtain firearms illegally and continue committing crimes.</p>

                <p>If gun control is made stricter in the United States, civilians will have fewer ways to protect themselves. Criminals could, therefore, be encouraged to perpetrate more crimes, including gun violence, because they will know that civilians have no way of protecting themselves. Rather than stricter gun control policies, the focus should be on educating the population on safer gun use. There should also be a focus on improving the overall mental health of American citizens, as several masterminds of gun violence have been shown to have been suffering from different mental illnesses. According to the National Rifle Association, the stricter background checks associated with more strict gun control simply do not work. By definition, criminals do not obey their laws. Hence, stricter gun control would keep guns from the hands of law-abiding citizens while it would be business as usual for criminals. Is it not a coincidence that cities with the strictest gun control measures also have some of the highest levels of gun violence? This calls for a more sober approach to addressing gun violence rather than merely trying to control gun ownership more.</p>

                <p>Stricter gun control measures would also be in contradiction to the rights and freedoms of Americans that are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution’s second amendment protects gun ownership (ProCon). The United States is known globally for its respect for human rights and freedoms, and trying to breach these rights could cause public disgruntlement and even mass action. In addition, gun control laws have been widely perceived to target certain communities, for instance, people experiencing poverty and minorities (ProCon). The background checks done before an individual acquires a firearm could be construed to be an invasion of privacy. These and other legal, ethical, and logistical challenges reduce the feasibility of stricter gun control in ending gun violence.</p>

                <p>The Rand Corporation conducted a study to investigate what science has to say about the impacts of gun control policies. The researchers found that increasing minimum age requirements for ownership of guns had a moderate effect on reducing gun-related suicides. They also found that the surrender of firearms by prohibited possessors also moderately reduced violent crime. In addition, the study showed that bans on the sale of high-capacity magazines and assault weapons had limited impact in reducing mass shootings. These observations were reached after surveying several articles and research publications. </p>

                <p>In conclusion, gun control is a complicated issue and one that requires thorough study and review. The paper shows that some gun control laws are more effective than others, and some are completely ineffective. Hence, it is critical to find a middle ground in these laws and adjust them accordingly. The study has also highlighted the difficulty in enacting gun control laws in the United States. One area that many of these sources can agree on is that mandatory knowledge and proficiency tests could have a substantial impact on the number of negligent discharges and accidental deaths and injuries caused by firearms. Ultimately, gun control will not work if no efforts are made to enhance morality, adherence to the rule of law, and the mental well-being of all American citizens.</p>
